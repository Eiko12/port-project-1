# Testing

- I tested that this page works in different browsers such as: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari.
- I made sure the website is responsive with Googel dev tools, also I went on the website from my phone to see how it looks just incase dev tools were not accurate.
- I made sure all the buttons in the nav and all the buttons on the page were clickable and were not dead.
- I made sure the form works properly, each input is required so a blank form cant be submitted and the email input only accepts emails.
